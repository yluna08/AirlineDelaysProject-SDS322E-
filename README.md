## Project Overview:

**Description**: 

Our project analyzes the data of domestic flights, focusing on Texas, in order to find unique relationships between certain factors that can vary for an airplane's flight.

**Goals**:

- Look at the relationship between airports and delay times 
- Look at what kind of delay causes the longest departure delay
- Look at how weather affects delay times
- Look at the relationship between airlines and delay times
- Try to predict if a flight will be delayed
- Try to predict flight arrival delays
- Try to predict if a state is hurricane-prone based on flight information

**Data**:

The Airline On-Time Performance Data is a data set collected over time by the United States Department of Transportation. In this dataset, carriers report data for the flights operated, including their arrival/departure dates, carrier, origin, airport, causes of delay and cancellation, air time, and non-stop distance. The dataset spans from 1987 to the present. 
We also combined this flight data with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's hurricane and tropical storm impact data to explore how hurricanes and tropic storms impact flight delays.

**Hypotheses**:
1. Larger airports experience more frequent and longer delays than smaller airports because a larger volume flights is more difficult to manage. Additionally, the average flight distance for larger airports may be longer than for smaller airports, which may contribute to delay times.
2. Weather delay is the most important predictor of delay times because its density covers the longest delay times.
3. Differences in the number of flights affected by weather between states in certain months can be attributed to hurricane season.
4. Differences in carrier delay between different operating carrier is related to carrier sizes and flight destinations.
